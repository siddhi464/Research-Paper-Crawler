# 📚Research Paper Crawler 
## Team - Siddhi Vaidya, Shreya Gujarathi, Sanika Shidore, Shruti Thakur

This Java-based research assistant crawls Google Scholar and arXiv in real-time, offering dynamic keyword search and auto-suggestions to enhance research efficiency. It provides customizable filters, smart ranking, and personalized alerts for the most relevant papers. Users can stay updated with the latest research, ensuring quick access to quality academic content. This tool enables users to explore citation paths, identify isolated works, and interactively filter results by author or year of publication.

## 🎯 Why This Project is Helpful

🔬 **For Researchers**:  
- Quickly visualize how research papers are interconnected.
- Identify influential papers through citation paths.
- Spot isolated or under-cited research for potential exploration.

🎓 **For Students**:  
- Gain clarity on how academic papers build upon each other.
- Discover related work efficiently without manual digging.
- Learn core data structures (like graphs and tries) through a real-world application.

This tool serves as both a **research aid** and an **educational demo**, bridging theoretical computer science concepts with practical academic workflows.

## 🚀 Features

- 📈 **Citation Graph Construction**: Builds a directed graph where nodes represent papers and edges represent citations.
- 🔍 **Related Paper Suggestions**: Suggests papers by tracing citation paths.
- 🚫 **Isolated Paper Detection**: Identifies papers that are not cited by or do not cite others.
- 🎯 **Interactive Filtering**: Filter nodes by author name and publication year for focused analysis.
- 🧠 **Keyword Auto-Suggestions**: Built-in search assistance using trie-based suggestions.

## 🧩 Core DSA Implementations

- **Trie**  
  Efficient keyword auto-completion based on user input.
